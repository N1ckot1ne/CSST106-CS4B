# **Feature Matching and Image Alignment Using SIFT, AKAZE, and ORB in OpenCV**

This project demonstrates the use of SIFT, AKAZE, and ORB feature detection and matching algorithms in OpenCV. The main goals are to compare the performance of these algorithms in terms of accuracy and speed and to use the matched points to align two images based on homography transformation.
