# **Feature Detection and Matching Algorithms**

This project includes three feature detection and description algorithms:

* SIFT: A robust feature detector based on scale-space extrema, available in OpenCV’s contrib module.

* AKAZE: An efficient alternative to SURF, optimized for binary feature descriptors.

* ORB: A fast binary descriptor that is especially effective for real-time applications.

Each algorithm is compared based on:

* Accuracy: Number of feature matches found between images.
* Speed: Execution time measured using Python’s time module for each feature extraction, description, and matching stage.

# **Conclusion**

*To analyze and compare the performance of the SIFT, AKAZE, and ORB algorithms, we evaluate them based on accuracy and speed. Accuracy is assessed by counting the number of matched points for each algorithm, offering insights into how effectively each method finds correspondences between the two images. Speed is measured by using Python’s time module to record the execution time for each feature extraction, descriptor computation, and matching step, allowing us to compare the computational efficiency of each algorithm. This combined analysis of accuracy and speed provides a clear understanding of the strengths and limitations of SIFT, AKAZE, and ORB for feature matching and image alignment tasks.*

*The substitution of SURF with AKAZE was due to licensing constraints and compatibility limitations inherent to SURF within certain OpenCV configurations. SURF is a patented algorithm, which restricts its availability in freely accessible versions of OpenCV. AKAZE, on the other hand, is freely available under a non-proprietary license, making it a suitable alternative without the need for additional installations. Furthermore, AKAZE is optimized for binary feature descriptors, which ensures compatibility with other methods, such as ORB, while offering efficient performance and maintaining reliable accuracy in feature extraction and matching processes.*
