# **Image Processing Techniques**
This project demonstrates various fundamental image processing techniques using OpenCV in Google Colab, including image transformations (scaling and rotation) and filtering techniques (blurring and edge detection). These methods provide foundational skills for manipulating and analyzing images, applicable to many fields like computer vision, AI, and digital media.

**CONTENTS**

* Image Transformations: Scaling and rotating images.
* Filtering Techniques: Applying Gaussian blurring and edge detection.
* Scenario-Based Problem-Solving: Combining techniques to solve practical tasks.
