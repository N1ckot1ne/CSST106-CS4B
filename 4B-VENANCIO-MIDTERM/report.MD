# **COCO Dataset Download and Extraction**
This guide explains how to download and extract the COCO 2017 training dataset for use in machine learning or computer vision projects.

**Steps to Download and Extract COCO 2017 Train Set**

**1.  Create Directory.** create a directory structure to store the dataset:

```bash
mkdir -p datasets/coco
```

**2.  Download the Dataset.** Use curl to download the COCO 2017 training data (train2017.zip) into the datasets/coco directory:

```bash
curl -L "http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip" -o datasets/coco/train2017.zip
```

**3.  Extract the Dataset. ** Once downloaded, unzip the file into the datasets/coco directory:

```bash
unzip -q datasets/coco/train2017.zip -d datasets/coco/
```

This will extract all images in the train2017 set to datasets/coco/train2017/.

**Directory Structure.**After completing these steps, your directory structure should look like this:

```python
datasets/
└── coco/
    ├── train2017.zip       # Original zip file (optional to keep)
    └── train2017/          # Extracted images
```
# **Implementing HOG-SVM**
This project demonstrates how to use the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) descriptor and a pre-trained SVM detector in OpenCV to detect people in an image.

**Requirements**
* Python (>=3.6 recommended)
* OpenCV (cv2)

**Setup**
1. Install OpenCV. 

```python
pip install opencv-python
```
2. Prepare an Input Image. Place an example image at datasets/coco/processed/example_image.jpg or update the image_path variable in the code with the path to your desired image.

**How it Works**
The code initializes a HOG descriptor, sets up a pre-trained SVM detector for human detection, and then processes the specified image to detect people. Detected people are highlighted with bounding boxes.

Code Explanation
```python
import cv2

# Initialize HOG descriptor and set SVM detector
hog = cv2.HOGDescriptor()
hog.setSVMDetector(cv2.HOGDescriptor_getDefaultPeopleDetector())

# Load an example image and perform detection
image_path = "datasets/coco/processed/example_image.jpg"
image = cv2.imread(image_path)

if image is None:
    print(f"Error: Unable to load image at {image_path}")
else:
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Detect people in the image
    boxes, weights = hog.detectMultiScale(gray, winStride=(8, 8))

    # Draw bounding boxes around detected people
    for (x, y, w, h) in boxes:
        cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

    # Save the output image
    cv2.imwrite("output.jpg", image)
```

**Key Points**
* **HOG Descriptor**: Initializes the HOG descriptor and sets up the default people detector.
* **Detecting People**: The detectMultiScale function finds people in the image.
* **Drawing Bounding Boxes**: For each detection, a bounding box is drawn around the detected individual.

*Notes*
* **Error Handling**: If the image fails to load, an error message is displayed.
* **Output**: The processed image with bounding boxes is saved as output.jpg

**Running the Code**
1. Ensure your image path is correctly set in image_path.
2. Run the code to detect the image
3. Check output.jpg for the detection results.

**Additional Information**
The HOG + SVM combination is popular for real-time people detection but may have limitations in complex scenes. This setup provides a starting point for experimenting with HOG-based detection.

# **Displaying Output Image using Matplotlib**
1. If you haven't installed OpenCV and Matplotlib, you can install them using pip:

```python
pip install opencv-python matplotlib
```

2. Load and Display the Image. This code snippet reads an image (saved as output.jpg), converts it to RGB, and displays it without axes using Matplotlib:
```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import cv2

# Load and display the output image
image_output = cv2.imread("output.jpg")
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(image_output, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.axis("off")  # Hide axes
plt.show()
```
**Explanation**
* **Image Conversion**: OpenCV loads images in BGR format, so we convert it to RGB for accurate display with Matplotlib.
* **Display Settings**: plt.axis("off") hides the axes for a cleaner view of the image.

# **Image Classification using TensorFlow and MobileNetV2**
This guide demonstrates how to use a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for image classification in TensorFlow. Although MobileNetV2 is not a YOLO model, it serves as a placeholder for quick object classification.

**Requirements**
* TensorFlow

*Setup*
1. Install TensorFlow
```python
pip install tensorflow
```
2. Download or Prepare an Input Image. Make sure you have an image to classify, saved at datasets/coco/processed/000000000009.jpg, or update img_path in the code with the path to your own image.

**How it Works**
This code loads a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model with ImageNet weights and uses it to classify an input image. MobileNetV2 is optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications, and it’s useful for quick inference on common objects.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2

# Load pre-trained MobileNetV2 model
model = MobileNetV2(weights="imagenet")

# Load and preprocess the input image
img_path = "datasets/coco/processed/000000000009.jpg"
image = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
input_arr = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(image)
input_arr = tf.expand_dims(input_arr, axis=0)  # Create batch dimension

# Perform classification
predictions = model.predict(input_arr)
print("Predictions:", tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.decode_predictions(predictions, top=3))
```

**Key Points**
* **Image Preprocessing**: The image is resized to (224, 224) pixels and expanded to create a batch dimension.
* **Classification**: The model predicts the top 3 probable classes for the object in the image using the decode_predictions function.

**Output**
```plaintext
Predictions: [[('n03291819', 'envelope', 0.16275658), ('n03938244', 'pillow', 0.13262008), ('n03347037', 'fire_screen', 0.058112532)]]
```

# **Precision and Recall Calculation using scikit-learn**
This guide demonstrates how to calculate precision and recall for a binary classification task using the scikit-learn library.

**Requirements**
* scikit-learn

*Setup*
1. Instal scikit-learn
```python
pip install scikit-learn
```
**How it Works**
This code snippet calculates the precision and recall of predictions compared to actual ground truth labels.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score

# Ground truth labels
y_true = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]  # Actual labels
# Predicted labels
y_pred = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  # Model predictions

# Calculate precision and recall
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)

print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
```

**Key Points**
* **Ground Truth Labels**: y_true represents the actual labels for your dataset.
* **Predicted Labels**: y_pred represents the predicted labels from your model.
* **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
* **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.

**Output**
```platintext
Precision: 1.0
Recall: 0.75
```
#**Comparing YOLO to different algorithms**
*When comparing object detection algorithms like HOG-SVM, YOLO, and SSD, several factors such as speed and accuracy come into play. HOG-SVM is a traditional method that excels in scenarios with simpler backgrounds and fewer objects. It generally exhibits lower accuracy on complex images compared to modern deep learning methods, but it is significantly faster due to its lower computational overhead. In contrast, YOLO (You Only Look Once) is designed for real-time processing, providing high-speed detections by treating object detection as a single regression problem, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously. Although YOLO can achieve high accuracy, especially with well-trained models on large datasets, it may struggle with small objects or dense environments. SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) also offers a balance between speed and accuracy by utilizing a single deep learning network to predict multiple bounding boxes and class scores in one pass. While SSD typically outperforms HOG-SVM in accuracy, it may be slower than YOLO depending on the implementation and specific model architecture used. Ultimately, the choice between these algorithms depends on the specific requirements of the application, including the need for speed, the complexity of the scenes being analyzed, and the acceptable level of accuracy.*
